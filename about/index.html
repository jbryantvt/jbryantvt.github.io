		I love biology.
		But then I decided that I wanted to use biology to make the world a better place.
		But then I decided the coolest way to do that would be to program plants.
		But then I realized I needed to be able to program yeast before I could program plants.
		But then I realized I had to progam A BUNCH of yeast
		So now I'm programming a robot, to program the yeast, to program plants, to make the world a better place, through biology :)
