		I love the complex, mysterious and beautiful nature of biology. The natural world holds more secrets and solutions than we
		could ever imagine, which is why I have set out to learn more about it. I am a 3rd year PhD student in Biological Systems Engineering, and
		my main research objective is to get a better understanding of the genes that control plant growth. I'll use this knowledge to 
		engineer next generation crops that we desperately need to feed the growing global population. Engineering plants is a tedious and
		error-prone process, which has led me to develop an interest in automating biological research. Automation technology like DNA design algorithms and 
		liquid handling robots have the potential to expedite research and eliminate human error. As an aspiring bioengineer, it's my job to get an automated platform up and 
		running. Ultimately, I hope my research improves the productivity of other scientists and the quality of life of our growing population.
